    "This article takes a different approach. Rather than introducing itertools to you one function at a time, you will construct practical examples designed to encourage you to “think iteratively.” In general, the examples will start simple and gradually increase in complexity. *The real power lies in composing these functions to create fast, memory-efficient, and good-looking code.*  \n",
